About L4Re

Designed for safety and security
  Safety and security are first order design goals of the L4Re operating system
  framework. Instead of being an afterthought, the whole system is designed
  around this pillar.

From scratch
  L4Re has been designed and developed from scratch.

Open Source
  The L4Re Operating System Framework is an open source system from the
  beginning. This is a cornerstone for building secure and sovereign
  systems, and gives you full control.

Framework approach
  L4Re provides a breadth of components that can be mixed and matched as needed.
  This approach minimizes the amount of code involved to the required minimum,
  enabling effective safety and security systems.

Hypervisor
  L4Re features a hypervisor to run virtual machines.

Scalability
  The L4Re system scales from embedded systems up to high performance
  computing.

Real time
   L4Re features a real-time scheduler and supports running real-time
   work loads in L4Re applications as well as virtual machines.

Professional support
  The developers and maintainers of L4Re did their first steps towards L4Re
  more than 25 years ago in 1997 at the TU Dresden. The time has lead to a
  concentration of experience which by now is bundled at `Kernkonzept
  <https://www.kernkonzept.com>`_. Kernkonzept provides professional support
  and consulting for all questions around L4Re.
