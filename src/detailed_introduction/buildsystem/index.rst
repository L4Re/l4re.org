You already learned how to compile L4Re and the L4Re Microkernel for your local
architecture in :doc:`/getting_started/make`. Now you might want to
:doc:`cross compile L4Re <cross_compiling>`. There are a number of supported
architectures.

L4Re by default gets build with ``gcc``. You can also :doc:`configure the build
system to use Clang <clang>` instead.

Learn how to :doc:`keep L4Re up to date <updating>` using ``ham``.

If you are having problems using the buildsystem you can :doc:`shoot the
troubles <troubleshooting>` you encountered until now.
