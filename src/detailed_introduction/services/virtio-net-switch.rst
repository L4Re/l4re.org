The virtual network switch connects multiple clients with a virtual network
connection. It uses :term:`Virtio` as the transport mechanism. Each virtual switch port
implements the host-side of a :term:`Virtio` network device (virtio-net).

The virtual network switch can be setup to feature exactly one monitor port.
All traffic passing through the switch is mirrored to the monitor port. The
monitor port is read-only, and has no TX capability.
An optional packet filter can be configured and implemented to filter data
sent to the monitor port.
