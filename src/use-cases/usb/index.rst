USB Stack
=========

L4Re has a native USB stack available `here
<https://github.com/l4re/usb/>`_. Currently it contains an OHCI USB
controller driver and a USB HID driver for keyboard, mice and other input
devices. The `examples/assets
<https://github.com/L4Re/usb/tree/main/examples/assets>`_ directory contains
a Ned script and IO configuration showing how it is being used.
