Using eMMC/SDHCI
****************

``emmc-drv`` is an L4Re block driver for eMMC and SDHC devices. It works
also in QEMU, which we show here how to setup.

The function of the driver is to provide access to a eMMC/SDHC device per
granularity of GPT partitions. In other words, the driver provides one
Virtio-Block device per GPT partition on the storage device.


Setting up the setup
--------------------

The following ned script shows the necessary steps to launch the driver and
provide Virtio-block device to potential clients, such as a virtual machine
or an L4Re application.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../_static/use-cases/emmc-qemu/emmc-qemu.ned
   :language: lua
   :linenos:
   :caption: emmc-qemu.ned

The config file for IO looks like this. As QEMU provides the controller as a
PCIe device, no further setup is required.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../_static/use-cases/emmc-qemu/vbus.io

A module.list entry looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../_static/use-cases/emmc-qemu/modules.list
   :caption: modules.list

Put all the files in a directory picked up by L4Re's image generation.

Run it with QEMU
----------------

First, we need to create a disk image to be presented to QEMU and used as a
storage for the eMMC/SDHCI:

.. sourcecode:: shell

   dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/emmc.img bs=1M count=16

Then we need to create GPT partitions in the file. For simplicity we just
create a single partition. We also query the partition GUID as we need it to
put in the ned script.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../_static/use-cases/emmc-qemu/gdisk.txt

The use-case can be run like this in one command for arm64. Of course,
variables can also be put into your ``Makeconf.boot`` file, shortening the
below command to just ``make qemu E=emmc-qemu``. It also works on x86-64
accordingly.

.. sourcecode:: shell

   make qemu E=emmc-qemu \
        MODULES_LIST=$PWD/modules.list \
        MODULE_SEARCH_PATH=$PWD/fiasco/build \
        QEMU_OPTIONS="-M virt -cpu cortex-a57 -serial stdio -vnc none -m 1g -drive id=sd_disk,file=/tmp/emmc.img,if=none,format=raw -device sdhci-pci,id=sdhci -device sd-card,drive=sd_disk,spec_version=3"
