Getting Started
***************

There are a number of avenues available to get started with L4Re.

.. topic:: :doc:`Run pre-built images on Hardware </bsp/index>`

   To get a glimpse of how L4Re looks like, there are a number of pre-built
   images available together with the instructions on how to run them on
   specific hardware.


.. topic:: :doc:`Build L4Re locally with the Bob Build Tool <bob>`

   If you plan on working with L4re you might want to use the L4Re tutorial
   recipes together with the Bob Build Tool to build various pre-composed
   examples.

.. topic:: :doc:`Build L4Re locally with GNU Make <make>`

   If you plan on working not only with, but on L4Re, you will have to use the
   L4Re Build System that is based on GNU Make. The respective chapters will
   provide you with a detailed step-by-step introduction on how L4Re is
   compiled from scratch.
